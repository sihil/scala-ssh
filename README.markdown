_scala-ssh_ is a [Scala] library providing remote shell access via SSH.
It builds on [sshj] to provide the following features:

* Remote execution of one or more shell commands
* Access to `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr` and exitcode of remote shell commands
* Authentication via password or public key
* Host key verification via `known_hosts` file or explicit fingerprint
* Convenient configuration of remote host properties via config file, resource or directly in code
* Scala-idiomatic API


## Installation

The current release is *0.5.0*, it's available from <http://repo.spray.cc>.
If you use [SBT] you can pull in the _scala-ssh_ artifacts with:

    resolvers += "spray repo" at "http://repo.spray.cc"

    libraryDependencies += "com.decodified" %% "scala-ssh" % "0.5.0"

[sshj] uses [SLF4J] for logging, so you might want to also add [logback] to your dependencies:

    libraryDependencies += "ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "1.0.0"

Additionally, in many cases you will need the following two artifacts, which provide additional cypher and compression
support:

    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "org.bouncycastle" % "bcprov-jdk16" % "1.46",
      "com.jcraft" % "jzlib" % "1.0.7"
    )


## Usage

The highest-level API element provided by _scala-ssh_ is the `SSH` object. You use it like this:

    SSH("example.com") { client =>
      client.exec("ls -a").right.map { result =>
        println("Result:\n" + result.stdOutAsString())
      }
    }

This establishes an SSH connection to host `example.com` and gives you an `SshClient` instance that you can use
to execute one or more commands on the host.
`SSH.apply` has a second (optional) parameter of type `HostConfigProvider`, which is essentially a function returning
a `HostConfig` instance for a given hostname. A `HostConfig` looks like this:

    case class HostConfig(
      login: SshLogin,
      hostName: String = "",
      port: Int = 22,
      connectTimeout: Option[Int] = None,
      connectionTimeout: Option[Int] = None,
      commandTimeout: Option[Int] = None,
      useCompression: Boolean = false,
      hostKeyVerifier: HostKeyVerifier = ...,
      sshjConfig: Config = ...
    )

It provides all the details required for properly establishing an SSH connection.
If you don't provide an explicit `HostConfigProvider` the default one will be used. For every hostname you pass to the
`SSH.apply` method this default `HostConfigProvider` expects a file `~/.scala-ssh/{hostname}`, which contains the
properties of a `HostConfig` in a simple config file format (see below for details). The `HostResourceConfig` object
gives you alternative `HostConfigProvider` implementations that read the host config from JAR resources.


## Host Config File Format

A host config file is a UTF8-encoded text file containing `key = value` pairs, one per line. Blank lines and lines
starting with a `#` character are ignored. This is an example file:

    # simple password-based config
    login-type = password
    username = bob
    password = 123
    command-timeout = 5000
    enable-compression = yes

These key are defined:

* `login-type`: required, can be either `password` or `keyfile`

* `host-name`: optional, if not given the name of the config file is assumed to be the hostname

* `port`: optional, the default value is `22`

* `username`: required

* `password`: required for login-type `password`, ignored otherwise

* `keyfile`: optionally specifies the location of the user keyfile to use with login-type `keyfile`,
  if not given the default files `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_dsa` are tried, ignored for login-type `password`

* `passphrase`: optionally specifies the passphrase for the keyfile, if not given the keyfile is assumed to be
  unencrypted, ignored for login-type `password`

* `connect-timeout`: optionally specifies the number of milli-seconds that a connection request has to succeed in
  before triggering a timeout error, default value is 'no timeout'

* `connection-timeout`: optionally specifies the number of milli-seconds that an idle connection is held open before
  being closed due due to idleness, default value is 'no timeout'

* `commandTimeout`: optionally specifies the number of milli-seconds that a pending response to an issued command
  is waited for before triggering a timeout error, default value is 'no timeout'

* `use-compression`: optionally adds `zlib` compression to preferred compression algorithms, there is no guarantee
  that it will be successfully negotiatied, requires `jzlib` on the classpath (see 'installation' chapter) above,
  default is 'no'
